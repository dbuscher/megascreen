Atmospheric phase screen generator using a "woofer-tweeter" algorithm
======================================================================

This Python 3 module implements the algorithm described in the paper “Simulating Large Atmospheric Phase Screens Using a Woofer-Tweeter Algorithm.” Optics Express 24, no. 20 (October 3, 2016): 23566–71. https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.24.023566.


To see a customisable movie of the phase screens generated by this module, you can run an app over the web using Streamlit Share by following the link below:

Alternatively, view a short movie in a Jupyter notebook at

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dbuscher/megascreen/blob/master/tests/demos/phase_screen_movie.ipynb


Requirements
------------

The module runs under Python3 and requires ``numpy`` and ``scipy``.

For running some of the example code, the ``astropy`` library is used. 

Installation
------------

On unix-like systems do

::

    pip3 install MegaScreen

or if that does not work because of file permission errors, then
::

    sudo pip3 install MegaScreen

 
Alternatively download and unpack a copy of this repository, change the working directory to this directory and then use

::

    pip3 install -e .


This should install the package into the Python path.

Usage
-----
See the documentation at http://megascreen.readthedocs.io/ for a description on how to use the module.
