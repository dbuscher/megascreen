===========================
 The MegaScreen() function
===========================

The `MegaScreen()` function has a large number of arguments/parameters as described in the docstring below. All the parameters have sensible defaults, but it is usually necessary to change a few of the parameters to suit any particular application. Advice on how to choose these parameter values is given in later sections.

Because of the large number of arguments, it is recommended that the parameters which are changed from their defaults are changed by using the `keyword=value` argument convention, rather than using positional arguments, both for readability and to reduce any chance of forward/backward compatibility problems.
