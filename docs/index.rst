Welcome to MegaScreen's documentation!
======================================

MegaScreen implements the algorithm described in
[Buscher2016]_ for simulating perturbations to an optical wavefront corresponding to the Von-Karman-Kolmogrov-Tatarski model for propagation through turbulence. From the abstract:

   We describe an algorithm for simulating atmospheric wavefront perturbations over ranges of spatial and temporal scales spanning more than 4 orders of magnitude.  An open-source implementation of the algorithm written in Python can simulate the evolution of the perturbations more than an order-of-magnitude faster than real time. Testing of the implementation using metrics appropriate to adaptive optics systems and long-baseline interferometers show accuracies at the few percent level or better.
