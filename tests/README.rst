=======================
 Test and example code
=======================

The Jupyter notebooks in this folder test the accuracy of the phase screens produced by `MegaScreen()` by comparing various measures to closed-form solutions from the literature. Measures tested include the wavefront structure function, Zernike decomposition of the wavefronts and the power spectrum of fringe motion in a long-baseline interferometer.

The notebooks are accompanied by similarly-named `.py` files automatically generated by `Jupytext` from the notebooks: these are mostly useful for version control, but are valid python code in themselves. The files "zernike.py" and "theory.py" are modules providing useful functions which are imported into the notebooks.

Sub-folders include some additional example code, which are less quantitative tests and more illustrations of what can be done with the code, including generating an infinitely long "movie" of the phase screen.
